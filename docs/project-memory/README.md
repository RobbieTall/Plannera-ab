# Plannera Project Memory

## Current delivery checkpoint - 29 September 2026

**Commercial HOLD; Production activation is not authorised.** Item 78C's protected
run [36426605240](https://github.com/RobbieTall/Plannera-ab/actions/runs/36426605240)
passed with `READY_FOR_NON_PRODUCTION_ACCEPTANCE`. That synthetic gate does not
prove customer Word/PDF delivery. The current task reconciles presentation PRs
#433/#434/#435 and completes real protected Preview generation, downloads and
reopening for independent Byron/Kempsey projects. Local groundwork and checks
are prepared; Linux build, generation/persistence/UI and hosted evidence remain.

Read the [current delivery handover](see-document-delivery-handover.md) first. Preserve draft PR #450's
acceptance closeout and immutable runner evidence. Older dated status entries
below are historical, not instructions to recreate fixtures or rerun old pins.
Research Viewer (#448) and Project Controls (#449) remain deferred. Keep
Production checkout disabled and Production data/schema unchanged.

This folder is the canonical, in-repo product memory for Plannera.

Its purpose is to keep strategic direction durable and discoverable so planning, product, and engineering decisions stay aligned over time.

## What belongs here

- product philosophy and positioning references
- architecture decisions and constraints
- roadmap priorities and sequencing
- current focus and next actions
- confidence and quality standards

## Source-of-truth map

1. Product philosophy: `docs/plannera-product-philosophy.md`
2. JIT LGA architecture: `docs/architecture/just-in-time-lga-activation.md`
3. Council Edition strategy: `docs/project-memory/council-assessment-strategy.md`
4. Project memory index (this folder): `docs/project-memory/README.md`
5. Build-next queue: `docs/project-memory/build-next.md`
6. Active decisions register: `docs/project-memory/decision-register.md`

## Maintenance rule

Any PR that changes product direction, delivery model, confidence policy, or roadmap sequencing must update at least one file in `docs/project-memory/`.

Every merged Codex task must also update `docs/project-memory/build-next.md` to mark the completed item as ✅ DONE and add any follow-up items discovered. If the task changes LGA coverage state, active focus, or next actions, update this file too so anyone picking up the project can read the current state without digging through git history.
