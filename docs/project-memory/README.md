# Plannera Project Memory

This folder is the canonical, in-repo product memory for Plannera.

Its purpose is to keep strategic direction durable and discoverable so planning, product, and engineering decisions stay aligned over time.

## What belongs here

- product philosophy and positioning references
- architecture decisions and constraints
- roadmap priorities and sequencing
- current focus and next actions
- confidence and quality standards

## Source-of-truth map

1. Product philosophy: `docs/plannera-product-philosophy.md`
2. JIT LGA architecture: `docs/architecture/just-in-time-lga-activation.md`
3. Council Edition strategy: `docs/project-memory/council-assessment-strategy.md`
4. Project memory index (this folder): `docs/project-memory/README.md`
5. Build-next queue: `docs/project-memory/build-next.md`
6. Active decisions register: `docs/project-memory/decision-register.md`

7. Research Viewer product contract: `docs/product/research-viewer.md`
8. Research Viewer first task: `docs/project-memory/research-viewer-first-task.md`
9. Research Viewer operations: `docs/operations/research-viewer.md`

## Current priority

Finish current commercial gates and their prerequisite fixes, then build Research Viewer RV0/RV1 for Byron and Kempsey. RV2 adds reviewed downstream evidence linkage and one DA-tracker adapter; remote browsing is deferred. This is a roadmap decision, not feature or commercial acceptance.

## Maintenance rule

Any PR that changes product direction, delivery model, confidence policy, or roadmap sequencing must update at least one file in `docs/project-memory/`.

Every merged Codex task must also update `docs/project-memory/build-next.md` to mark the completed item as ✅ DONE and add any follow-up items discovered. If the task changes LGA coverage state, active focus, or next actions, update this file too so anyone picking up the project can read the current state without digging through git history.
