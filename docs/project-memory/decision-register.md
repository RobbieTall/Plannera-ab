# Decision Register

A compact register of active product/architecture decisions.

## DR-001 — Product Philosophy Anchor

**Status:** Active  
**Decision:** Plannera turns planning complexity into project intelligence, with explicit confidence handling and source-aware guidance.  
**Reference:** `docs/plannera-product-philosophy.md`

## DR-002 — Staged Intelligence Delivery

**Status:** Active  
**Decision:** Start with usable search-supported capability, then progress to structured controls and verified rule packs. Do not pretend partial ingestion is complete intelligence.  
**Reference:** `docs/plannera-product-philosophy.md`

## DR-003 — Just-in-Time LGA Activation

**Status:** Active  
**Decision:** For unsupported LGAs, return immediate baseline guidance and trigger asynchronous local DCP/mapping preparation. Do not run full DCP parse in live request path.  
**Reference:** `docs/architecture/just-in-time-lga-activation.md`

## DR-004 — Truthful User Messaging

**Status:** Active  
**Decision:** Use restrained language during local preparation (e.g., “reviewing local controls”); avoid “correct/complete” certainty until confidence level supports it.  
**Reference:** `docs/architecture/just-in-time-lga-activation.md`
